**Title: Frontend Assets**
  - This project was something I was looking forward to making for a long time. As an aspiriring frontend software developer I wanted to give others who are learning or currently in the industry a platform to find/add & use the resources that I have found over the years that have helped me.

**Live ðŸ”—:** https://frontend-assets.vercel.app/

**Installation:** 
  - React
  - NextJS
  - NextSEO
  - TailwindCSS

**Usage:** 
  - This project is a frontend application that is used for the resources provided. Instead of having all of your resources in an endless folder I wanted to create a easy to search filter for specific needs.

**Key Features:** 
  - Ability to add your own resources you found useful
  - Searching for resources quick & easy with a search filter
  - Being a part of a community striving to find success in frontend development

**Deployment:** 
  - I used Vercel which is a great and easy way to deploy next applications.
