**Title: Frontend Assets**
  - This project was something I was looking forward to making for a long time. As an aspiriring frontend software developer I wanted to give others who are learning or currently in the industry a platform to find/add & use the resources that I have found over the years that have helped me.

**Live ðŸ”—:** https://frontend-assets.vercel.app/

**Installation:** React, NextJS, NextSEO, TailwindCSS

**Usage:** This project is a frontend application that is used for the resources provided. Instead of having all of your resources in an endless folder I wanted to create a easy to search filter for specific needs.

**Key Features:** This project doesn't have a database but is still in development. The add your own resources is not implemented yet but having the option to use the resources provided is still there & being updated with more resources all the time.

**Deployment:** I used Vercel which is a great and easy way to deploy next applications.
